# Online_Book_Store_By_Using_MySQL

This project analyzes data from an Online Book Store database using SQL.
The database includes tables for Books, Customers, and Orders, with relationships established through primary and foreign keys.
Key insights include identifying popular genres (Fiction & Fantasy), repeat customers, top spenders, busiest months (November 2023),
and inventory optimization. SQL skills like JOINs, aggregate functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT), and GROUP BY were used to extract and analyze data.
